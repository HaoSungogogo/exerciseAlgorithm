final -> must be initialized

protect > default
subclass -> subclass from different package, also could find the protected field.

private field may not need getter /setter, eg, we may not want this field viewed by outside.

abstract class 不一定有 abstract method. but it is still abstract class, not be initialized
can have constructor

Abstract class: base class implementation to derived class

base class -> interface, abstract class and concrete class

file system -> read, write -> only provide interface -> memory, disk, distributed system file system
interface -> no data field

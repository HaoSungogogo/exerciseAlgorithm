the key for DP problem:
1. find the meaning of each element in the table
2. fill in the table

The relation with Recursion:

1. Recursion solve the problem from the large size to small size, and do not record any sub-problem, only think about:
	a. base case
	b. recursion rule
2. DP solve the proble from small size to large size and record sub-problem
	a. base case
	b. induction rule 
       (size(< n) subsolution-> size(n) solution)
